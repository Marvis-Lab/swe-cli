## CRITICAL: Docker Environment

YOU ARE RUNNING INSIDE A DOCKER CONTAINER.

Working directory: {workspace_dir}
All file paths MUST be relative (e.g., `file.py`, `src/file.py`) or start with {workspace_dir}/.

NEVER use paths like:
- /Users/...
- /home/...
- Any absolute path outside {workspace_dir}

ALWAYS use paths like:
- pyproject.toml
- src/model.py
- config.yaml

Use ONLY the filename or relative path for all file operations.
