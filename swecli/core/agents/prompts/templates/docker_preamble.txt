## CRITICAL: Docker Environment

YOU ARE RUNNING INSIDE A DOCKER CONTAINER.

Working directory: {working_dir}
All file operations execute inside the container.

FILE PATHS - VERY IMPORTANT:
- CORRECT: `pyproject.toml`, `src/model.py`, `config.yaml`
- WRONG: `/Users/.../file.py`, `/home/.../file.py`

NEVER use absolute paths like /Users/, /home/, /var/.
ALWAYS use relative paths (just the filename or relative path like src/file.py).
