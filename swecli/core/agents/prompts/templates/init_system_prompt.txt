Analyze the codebase at {path} and generate a CONCISE OPENDEV.md (max 200 words).

Use spawn_subagent with Code-Explorer:
"Explore {path}. Read config files (package.json/pyproject.toml/Makefile) and README. Report: tech stack, install/run/test/lint commands, main directories."

After exploration, use write_file to create {path}/OPENDEV.md with this exact format:

```
# Project Name

One-sentence description.

## Commands
- Install: `actual command`
- Run: `actual command`
- Test: `actual command`
- Lint: `actual command`

## Structure
- `src/` - Source code
- `tests/` - Tests
(only list 3-5 key directories)

## Style
- Brief bullet points only
```

CRITICAL: Keep it under 200 words. No lengthy explanations. Use real commands from config files.
