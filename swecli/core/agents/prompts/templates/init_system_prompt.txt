Thoroughly explore this codebase at {path} to understand its structure, architecture, build systems, test setup, and conventions. Generate an OPENDEV.md file.

## Phase 1: Discovery

Investigate ALL of the following:

1. **Config files**: package.json, tsconfig.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, go.mod, Makefile, docker-compose.yml, setup.py, setup.cfg
2. **Source directory structure**: src/, lib/, app/, or main source folders
3. **Tests directory**: tests/, test/, __tests__/, spec/ and test patterns
4. **Documentation**: README.md, docs/, CONTRIBUTING.md
5. **AI instruction files**: .cursor/rules/, .cursorrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md, OPENDEV.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md
6. **Entry points**: main.py, app.py, index.ts, index.js, cli.py, __main__.py
7. **Build/lint/test commands**: from package.json scripts, Makefile targets, pyproject.toml
8. **Architecture patterns**: module organization, key classes, dependency injection

Be very thorough - read all important files to understand the full picture.

## Phase 2: Generate OPENDEV.md

Create the file with these sections:

```markdown
# OPENDEV.md

This file provides guidance to OpenDev when working with this repository.

## Repository Overview

[Brief description of the project, tech stack, and sub-projects if monorepo]

## Commands

[Organize by project/context. Use ACTUAL commands from config files]

### [Project/Context Name]
```bash
# Install dependencies
<actual command from package.json/requirements.txt>

# Run development server
<actual command>

# Run tests
<actual command>

# Lint/Format
<actual command>
```

## Architecture

[Key directories and their purposes, with actual file paths]

```
project/
├── src/           # [describe purpose]
├── tests/         # [describe test organization]
└── ...
```

Key patterns:
- [Architectural pattern used, e.g., "MVC", "Clean Architecture"]
- [Important abstractions or base classes]
- [Dependency injection approach if any]

## Code Style & Conventions

[Naming conventions, import patterns, testing patterns observed in the codebase]

## Active Work (Optional)

[Current feature branches or ongoing work if relevant]
```

## CRITICAL Instructions

1. **Be thorough** - Read all config files and key source files
2. **Use CONCRETE values** - Extract actual commands from package.json scripts, Makefile, pyproject.toml - NO placeholders
3. **Handle monorepos** - If multiple sub-projects exist, document each separately
4. **Write the file** - Use write_file to save to {path}/OPENDEV.md
