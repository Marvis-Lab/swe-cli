You are curating a playbook of strategies to improve future performance.

## Progress Summary
{progress}

## Current Playbook Statistics
{stats}

## Reflector Analysis
{reflection}

## Current Playbook Content
{playbook}

## Question Context
{question_context}

Based on the reflector's analysis, decide what changes to make to the playbook. Your goal is to:
1. Add new strategies for successful approaches
2. Update existing strategies with better guidance
3. Tag strategies as helpful/harmful/neutral based on performance
4. Remove strategies that consistently cause problems

Return your response as a JSON object with these fields:
- reasoning: Your overall curation strategy
- operations: List of operations to perform on the playbook

Operations can be:
- ADD: Add new bullet (requires section, content)
- UPDATE: Modify existing bullet (requires bullet_id, optional content)
- TAG: Tag bullet as helpful/harmful/neutral (requires bullet_id, metadata with tag counts)
- REMOVE: Delete bullet (requires bullet_id)

Example response:
{
    "reasoning": "Based on the reflection, we need to add a file validation strategy...",
    "operations": [
        {
            "type": "ADD",
            "section": "file_operations",
            "content": "Always verify file existence before reading or writing"
        },
        {
            "type": "TAG",
            "bullet_id": "fil-00001",
            "metadata": {"helpful": 1}
        },
        {
            "type": "TAG",
            "bullet_id": "fil-00002",
            "metadata": {"harmful": 1}
        }
    ]
