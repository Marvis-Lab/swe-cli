You are analyzing a response to identify what went right or wrong.

## Question

## Tools Used
{tool_summary}

## Ground Truth (if available)
{ground_truth}

## Feedback/Execution Result
{feedback}

## Current Playbook Strategies
{playbook_content}

Analyze the performance and provide insights. Focus on:
1. What went wrong in the agent's approach or tool usage
2. The root cause of any errors or inefficiencies
3. What would have been the correct approach
4. Key insights for future improvements
5. Which current playbook strategies were helpful, harmful, or neutral
6. What new strategies should be added to the playbook

Return your response as a JSON object with these fields:
- reasoning: Your overall analysis
- error_identification: What specifically went wrong
- root_cause_analysis: Why it went wrong
- correct_approach: What should have been done instead
- key_insight: The most important lesson to learn
- bullet_tags: List of objects with "id" and "tag" fields ("helpful", "harmful", or "neutral")
- suggested_strategies: List of new strategies that should be added to the playbook

Example response:
{
    "reasoning": "The agent attempted to read a file without checking if it exists first...",
    "error_identification": "File read operation failed due to missing existence check",
    "root_cause_analysis": "Agent followed pattern of direct file access without validation",
    "correct_approach": "Always verify file existence before reading or writing",
    "key_insight": "File operations require validation steps to prevent errors",
    "bullet_tags": [
        {"id": "fil-00001", "tag": "harmful"},
        {"id": "fil-00003", "tag": "helpful"}
    ],
    "suggested_strategies": [
        "Always check file existence before read operations",
        "Use try-catch blocks for file operations"
    ]
